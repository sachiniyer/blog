# Preface

Posting about getting into companies is a tricky topic for me. Back in Apr 2023, I said my goal with this blog was:

> My goal is only post about things that I will find useful for future me (and which therefore may be useful to you).

My objective is not to brag or stroke my ego, but remains to provide information that is valuable to future me. Let me know if you think I crossed the line, and I will adjust my language.

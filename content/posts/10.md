# API 

The API[^code] is super simple.


## MNIST Data[^mnist]

I create some basic endpoints for get a [sample of MNIST](https://github.com/sachiniyer/mnist-wasm/blob/24ba3cd78442de1c142756eb4bde5bf42f870a3c/api/src/main.rs#L72) or a [block of MNIST samples](https://github.com/sachiniyer/mnist-wasm/blob/24ba3cd78442de1c142756eb4bde5bf42f870a3c/api/src/main.rs#L81)[^mnisttype].

## Weights

I create some endpoints for dealing with the model weights stored in the API.

- [GET](https://github.com/sachiniyer/mnist-wasm/blob/24ba3cd78442de1c142756eb4bde5bf42f870a3c/api/src/main.rs#L62) - get the weights stored in the API
- [POST](https://github.com/sachiniyer/mnist-wasm/blob/24ba3cd78442de1c142756eb4bde5bf42f870a3c/api/src/main.rs#L67) - put some weights in the API
- [PATCH](https://github.com/sachiniyer/mnist-wasm/blob/24ba3cd78442de1c142756eb4bde5bf42f870a3c/api/src/main.rs#L90) - send some data, and have the API update the weights by training on that data block
- [DELETE](https://github.com/sachiniyer/mnist-wasm/blob/24ba3cd78442de1c142756eb4bde5bf42f870a3c/api/src/main.rs#L115) - delete the weights in the API, and have it refresh itself by retraining for some iterations[^iter]

## Other API functions

I put some semi-useful stuff into logs[^level]:

- Times weights are cleared
- Accuracy of the model
- Some information about the data

# Deployment

I use [my cluster](https://wiki.sachiniyer.com/#!index.md)[^clusterrepo] to deploy the API and site[^config]. There are docker images for the [api](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sachiyer/mnist-wasm-api/general) and [site](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sachiyer/mnist-wasm-site/general)[^cd].

You can build this yourself with a simple `docker compose up --build`.

## Image details

I made some semi-interesting optimizations to get rid of the space intensive build artifacts. 

At the end the API image just contains the final API binary, data, and some weights. The site image just contains the static objects needed to serve the site (with an nginx base image).

# Final Links
 And this short posts summarizes this project. To see the project in action check out [my deployment](https://digits.sachiniyer.com).

[^code]: [code](https://github.com/sachiniyer/mnist-wasm/blob/master/api/src/main.rs)
[^mnist]: Yann LeCun still hosts [the original data](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html)
[^mnisttype]: I do this mostly for convenience of types. It could live under one endpoint.
[^iter]: The amount of iterations is decided by [env vars](https://github.com/sachiniyer/mnist-wasm/blob/master/api/env.sample)
[^level]: I also defined some logging levels decided by [env vars](https://github.com/sachiniyer/mnist-wasm/blob/master/api/env.sample)
[^clusterrepo]: [main repository](https://github.com/sachiniyer/cheap_portable_k3s)
[^config]: [configuration files](https://github.com/sachiniyer/k3s-configs/tree/master/digits)
[^cd]: These are built through [github actions](https://github.com/sachiniyer/mnist-wasm/blob/master/.github/workflows/rust.yml) that lint, test, and build the codebase

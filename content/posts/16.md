# The Books

I have been reading some late 1990s and early 2000s books about software engineering. I am not a huge fan of "reading lists" (not sure if I am going to take much for Metamorphosis today), but these are the related books I read in 2023.

- Hackers and Painters
- Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary
- The Soul of a New Machine
- Free Culture
- The Search
- The Mythical Man-Month
- Coders at Work
- Founders at Work: Stories of Startups' Early Days
- Dealers of Lightning

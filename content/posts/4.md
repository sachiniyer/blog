# Goals

When talking about this, I want to first establish a threat model. I will follow the questions listed in the [privacy guides](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/threat-modeling/)[^privacyguides] site.

#### What do I want to protect:

I want to protect mass aggregation of my data

#### Who do I want to protect it from

The actors are usually large advertising based corporations; Amazon, Google, Facebook... (surveillance capitalism).

#### How likely is it that I will need to protect it

It is likely. These corporations collect data every time you (or often your social network) interact with their services.

#### How bad are the consequences if I fail

One piece of data here and there may not influence too much (potentially unless it connects you with another person). The goal is to avoid mass aggregation.

#### How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences

I need a degree. Whatever I can do up to the point of jeopardizing my degree.

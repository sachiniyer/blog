This site is deployed on my [kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/sachiniyer/cheap_portable_k3s/).

I took some inspiration from [this](https://dmarkey.com/2020/01/continuous-deployment-with-hugo-on-kubernetes/) blog post. I was planning to use git sync anyway, but it was nice to see that someone else was doing it as well.

# How did this happen?

- **2 Weeks:** I want to build a Neural Net with Rust as a learning experience. It will be interesting to implement the activation functions and backpropogation.
- **1 Months:** Rust and WASM play nice, would it be possible to put this on the web.
- **2 Months:** If I put this on the web, then I better use Rust for the frontend as well.
- **6 Months:** If I have a website, I better be able to train it, cache effectively, and run this in parallel to the rendering

Everyone, this is what we call _scope creep_.

# What is this?

Essentially, I created a simple digit detector (with the MNIST dataset). This detector uses a 2 layer neural net (ReLU + LogSoftmax) built with Rust and then embedded into a website using the [yew](https://yew.rs/) framework. This website calls an API for samples and weights.

## Model
The model has the following features
- 1 layer of ReLU
- 1 layer of LogSoftmax
- Written in Rust only with the help of the [ndarray](https://docs.rs/ndarray/latest/ndarray/) package
- Optimized for single sample and batch training

## Website
The website has the following features and more:
- Training of the model in a parallel web worker
- Pre-cached samples with async replenishment
- Loading of samples on-demand for inference
- Grid to draw your own digit
- Various inputs to tune the training and inference

## API
The api has the following features and more:
- Load an MNIST sample
- Load a block of MNIST samples
- Getters and Setters for Model weights


# What is next?

I will be creating 3 more posts:

### [Part 2](/posts/8)

Details about the model with a little bit of math and code

### Part 3

Details about the frontend, and how I was able to jam in all the features I desired

### Part 4
Details about the api, deployment, and integration details

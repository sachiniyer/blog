# Overview

## Links
- [project](https://digits.sachiniyer.com) - probably want to train a bit before trying an example
- [repository](https://github.com/sachiniyer/mnist-wasm)
- [api](https://digits-api.sachiniyer.com)
- [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) - don't roll your own rust wasm like me

## How did this happen?

- **2 Weeks:** I want to build a Neural Net with Rust as a learning experience. It will be interesting to implement the activation functions and backpropogation.
- **1 Months:** Rust and WASM play nice, would it be possible to put this on the web.
- **2 Months:** If I put this on the web, then I better use Rust for the frontend as well.
- **6 Months:** If I have a website, I better be able to train it, cache effectively, and run this in parallel to the rendering

Everyone, this is what we call _scope creep_.

## What is this?

Essentially, I created a simple digit detector (with the MNIST dataset). This detector uses a 2 layer neural net (ReLU + LogSoftmax) built with Rust and then embedded into a website using the [yew](https://yew.rs/) framework. This website calls an API for samples and weights.

The website has the following features and more:
- Training of the model in a parallel web worker
- Pre-cached samples with async replenishment
- Loading of samples on-demand for inference
- Grid to draw your own digit
- Various inputs to tune the training and inference

The api has the following features and more:
- Load an MNIST sample
- Load a block of MNIST samples
- Getters and Setters for Model weights

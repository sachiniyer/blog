# Rabbitholeathon
I reached the waitlist for [rabbitholeathon](https://www.rabbitholeathon.com/) but am semi-proud of my application, so here it is. I think I was pretty close.

Some ideas that I am working on/thinking about:

- Federated Wireguard key management with Headscale
- Privacy Reviews of Music Tech - Ã  la mozilla's privacynotincluded
- Lemmy (federated reddit) community graph - connections between subs/servers

# Tell us about some rabbitholes

I will just focus on one, which is my obsession with Aaron Swartz. I think I was semi-afraid of having opinions and speaking out about politics or advocacy. Was it because of insecurity, impostor syndrome, or worries of rejection by those around me? I\'m not sure. Do those feelings persist to the present? Maybe.

However, Aaron Swartz was (and is) an amazing proxy for many of the ideals I hold near and dear. His beliefs on freedom of information, democratizing technology, privacy rights, and governmental transparency correspond almost exactly with what I believe in.

In his honor, and in line with the Guerilla Open Access Manifesto, I created a JSTOR proxy in my freshman year with a small network exploit and a set of Raspberry Pis. It has since (probably for the best) gone down. I also created a openly contributable archive of textbooks necessary to get through all of our engineering classes. Orders of magnitude more time that semester were spent on ways to fulfill the ideals of open access than on actual schoolwork.

In the past few months, I have \"gone down the rabbit hole\" and read all his previous blog posts, gone through all the still live links in his [pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:aaronsw/public), and listened to a bunch of his old talks. There are so many more things I learned...

# On person-problem fit.

I believe I have good alignment with some strong principles. By alignment I mean the difference between my values and the way I live. I also have a good understanding of technology. This puts me in a great position to build software that furthers my values. However, another position, albeit less explored, is to write about and research my technological beliefs.

Some of my core technological principles are:

- "Free Software; Free Society" - RMS (I idolize the message, not the person)
- Privacy is a Human Right - as described in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- "Information wants to be free" - Stewart Brand

I am also in the center the venn diagram of three circles:

- Read many of the writings of late '90s and 2000s internet advocates
- Part of the new generation of software engineers (influenced by FAANG and ML)
- A desire to further my thoughts in internet advocacy

Although somewhat uncomfortable, I think I have all the necessary tools and knowledge to start crafting positions and arguments in favor of my beliefs.

# What do you plan on exploring

I usually gravitate to technological problems with clear engineering-based solutions. However, if I come to rabbitholeathon, I would like to push myself. Instead, I would want to read/write about modern federation.

Here are some things I might try to do:

- Aim to write my own declaration about the necessity of federation and decentralized control in social media networks. It may include reasoning about why centralized, proprietary social network are dangerous and unethical, as well as why federated networks are the natural solution to uphold fundamental human rights.
- Try to understand the fundamental motives for federation. Why would we like spreading out our information everywhere? Why did the internet start federated? Does society actually care about federation?
-   I find that the people closest to a technology are often the best to find flaws in that technology (see [Gary Klein's Premortem](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem)). I think it would be productive to actually try to find the major flaws in federation, and why it could fail.

# Anything else we should know

Dietary Restrictions - I am vegan (another one of those belief alignment things)
